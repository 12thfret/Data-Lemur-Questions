### Problem Statement

**Objective**: Write a SQL query to create a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. Group users by the number of tweets they posted in 2022 and count the number of users in each group.

**Table Name**: `tweets`

| Column Name | Data Type | Description                                   |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| tweet_id    | integer   | Unique identifier for each tweet.             |
| user_id     | integer   | Unique identifier for the user who posted it. |
| msg         | string    | Content of the tweet.                         |
| tweet_date  | timestamp | Timestamp of when the tweet was posted.       |

---

**Example Input** (tweets table):

| tweet_id | user_id | msg                                                        | tweet_date           |
|----------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| 214252   | 111     | Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured. | 2021-12-30 00:00:00 |
| 739252   | 111     | Despite the constant negative press covfefe                 | 2022-01-01 00:00:00 |
| 846402   | 111     | Following @NickSinghTech on Twitter changed my life!        | 2022-02-14 00:00:00 |
| 241425   | 254     | If the salary is so competitive why wonâ€™t you tell me what it is? | 2022-03-01 00:00:00 |
| 231574   | 148     | I no longer have a manager. I can't be managed              | 2022-03-23 00:00:00 |

---

**Expected Output**:

| tweet_bucket | users_num |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1            | 2         |
| 2            | 1         |

---

**Explanation**:
- Users are grouped by the number of tweets they posted in 2022.
- Two users posted only one tweet in 2022 (`tweet_bucket = 1`).
- One user posted two tweets in 2022 (`tweet_bucket = 2`).

---

### SQL Query:

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
    user_id,
    COUNT(msg) as tweet_bucket
    FROM tweets
    WHERE date_trunc('year', tweet_date) = '2022-01-01'
    GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT
    tweet_bucket,
    COUNT(user_id) as users_num
    FROM cte
    GROUP BY tweet_bucket
```
.
---

The end.
